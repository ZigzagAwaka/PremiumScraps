I'm not an expert with custom Lethal Company code so if you can help with some of them, please contact me by posting a new github issue.
- When the host player is killed by the Fake Airhorn or The friendship ender, his dead body gets teleported in the void
- The friendship ender is anormaly spawning more enemies than wanted for non-host players
- The glowing rainbow variant for Balan Statue have a base of the wrong material
- Audio clips are played at a given position instead of coming from an audio source
- When using the Scroll of Town Portal, instead of being destroyed, the item gets teleported/moved under the map
- Some coroutines functions print errors in the console even if they are working as intended
- Sometimes, the Stick effect doesn't do anything but sometimes it works (also sometimes hits the wrong player?)
