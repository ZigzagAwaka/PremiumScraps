## Known issues
I'm not an expert at modding Lethal Company so if you can help with some of the following issues, please contact me in the Lethal Modding Discord server.
- **Low impact**
    - The glowing rainbow variant for Balan Statue has a lower part of the wrong material
    - Audio clips are played at a given position instead of coming from an audio source
    - When using the Scroll of Town Portal, instead of being destroyed, the item gets teleported/moved under the map
    - The spawned items of Basics of architecture does not have their scrap value displayed and their rotation are not synced for other players
- **Medium**
    - The friendship ender is anormaly spawning more entities than wanted for non-host players (but it's funny lmao)
    - The Stick special effect has been disable because of unstability: sometimes it doesn't do anything but sometimes it works (also sometimes hits the wrong player?)
- **High importance**
    - None
