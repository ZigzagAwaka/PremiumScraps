# PremiumScraps

This mod currently adds **28 scrap items** to the game ! 😎

These items can be cute, funny or stylish, some even have a custom effect!

Scraps in this mod have been made specifically to be discovered in a friend group, some of them even have secret interaction between players. It's recommended to keep the surprise but you can still take a look at the images bellow for a small preview.

All items are performance friendly.

This mod is automatically translated into french if you are french. *Please install [FontUpdate](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/rectorado/FontUpdate/) if you are playing the french mode.*

Compatible with v73 of Lethal Company.

### The friendship ender
- Can be used to do a special effect...
- Use it near your friends, I swear it's just for shits and giggles.

### Controller
- This electronic device can be used while pointing it at other players to do a little bit of trolling!
- The item will detect a potential target in front of it, and will then shoot a lightning bolt in front of you. Any crewmate hit by this strange magic will have their POV displayed on the device's screen.

- It also seems to have the ability to control one's movements. No one really knows how this works, but a few workers reported that their colleague were occasionally unable to control their own movements anymore...

### My ■■■■■■th job application
- Although you're not a recruiter, it really shouldn't hurt if you're the one inspecting it.
- If horror movies taught you one thing however, it is that reading strange out of place objects from forgotten facilities in obscure planets really isn't the safest idea for you and your f̣̓̊eͦ́ͦllo̵̶̍w͛ͮ͒ c͍o-̖̋w̸̱͎or̬͗kers... you can already picture everyone *diseappearing* or dying from *heart attacks*.

### Custom effect items
- **Scroll of Town Portal**, a rare consumable item, teleports its user to the ship.
- **Basics of architecture**, a book filled with forbidden knowledge, you can read it to learn how to use those screws you borrowed from your aunt.
- **El Gazpacho**, a tasty drink, will heal you when consumed but with a risk of having *"side-effects"*. How long will your body be able to stand up after a sip of this common spanish drink?

### Fake airhorn
- Can be used to make loud annoying sounds, just like a real airhorn would.
- Sometimes it will trigger a custom *bad effect*, are you sure that this is the real one?

### The talking orb
- Are you pondering the orb? Or is it the orb that is pondering you? Do not be surprised, for this orb will scream, speak and laugh at you.
- I'm keeping this one's appearance a secret since it's the rarest scrap in the mod.

### Weapons
- **Comically Large Spoon**, a classic, does a little more damage than the shovel.
- The legendary **Stick**, a non-lethal weapon, but you should not use it on your friends...
- **Bomb**, this explosive can be used to blow up things and people but it is also quite unstable so watch out.

### Serpent of Ronka
- This adorable little creature will spawn with a variety of different outfits, it will occasionally call for your presence with even cuter sounds...!

![Preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZigzagAwaka/PremiumScraps/main/Images/premiumscraps-ronka.png)

### Noisy items
- **The King**, **Puppy Shark** and **Moogle** can all be used to make some funny sounds !
- The little orange square is called **crouton**, it's an obscure internet refererence that can be heard anywhere on the map when droped.

### Classic items
- Scraps with no special effects, but they come with custom audio. Some can even glow in dark places.
- Some of these items may have a minor *secret custom effect* that no one knows about hehehe...

<details><summary>Unlucky players (secret feature!)</summary>

### Unlucky players
- Did you notice *oddly specific things* happening to certain players ? Things that you were unable to reproduce on your own ? With this mod installed, "unlucky players" will experience strange and secret phenomenons reserved only for them 😌

![Preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZigzagAwaka/PremiumScraps/main/Images/premiumscraps-unluckyplayers.png)

**If you enjoy inflicting excessive punishment on your friends, know that the status of "unlucky players" can be attributed to people yourself in the config file.**

### Notes
Each item has a low/medium spawn chance on all moons, you will not find them easily. This is to keep the game as vanilla as possible while adding some rare scraps to find if you are lucky !

*You can modify any spawn chance in the config file if you want to.*
