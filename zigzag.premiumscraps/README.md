# PremiumScraps

This mod currently adds **20 scrap items** to the game ! ðŸ˜Ž

These items can be cute, funny or stylish. They all have been cleaned to have no impact on performance.

Compatible with v50 of Lethal Company.

### The friendship ender
- Can be used to do a special effect...
- Use it near your friends, I swear it's just for shits and giggles.

### Custom effect items
- **Scroll of Town Portal**, a rare consumable item, teleports its user to the ship.
- **The basics of architecture**, a book filled with forbidden knowledge, you can read it to learn how to use those screws you borrowed from your aunt.

### Fake airhorn
- Can be used to make loud annoying sounds, just like a real airhorn would.
- Sometimes it will trigger a custom *bad* effect, are you sure that this is the real one?

### Weapons
- **Comically Large Spoon**, a classic, does a little more damage than the shovel.
- The legendary **Stick**, a non-lethal weapon, but you should not use it on your friends...

### Noisy items
- **The King** and **Puppy Shark** can both be used to make some funny sounds !
- The little orange square is called **crouton**, it's an obscure internet refererence that can be heard anywhere on the map when droped.

### Notes
Each item has a low/medium spawn chance on all moons, you will not find them easily. This is to keep the game as vanilla as possible while adding some rare scraps to find if you are lucky !

*You can modify any spawn chance in the config file if you want to.*

### Feedback
You can post some suggestions or issues in the [github](https://github.com/ZigzagAwaka/PremiumScraps).
