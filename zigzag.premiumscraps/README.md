# PremiumScraps

This mod currently adds **25 scrap items** to the game ! üòé

These items can be cute, funny or stylish. They all have been cleaned to have no impact on performance.

Compatible with v60/v61/v62/v64 of Lethal Company.

### The friendship ender
- Can be used to do a special effect...
- Use it near your friends, I swear it's just for shits and giggles.

### My ‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†th job application
- Although you're not a recruiter, it really shouldn't hurt if you're the one inspecting it.
- If horror movies taught you one thing however, it is that reading strange out of place objects from forgotten facilities in obscure planets really isn't the safest idea for you and your fÃìÃ£ÃäeÕ¶ÃÅÕ¶lloÃµÃ∂ÃçwÕõÕÆÕí cÕço-ÃãÃñwÃ∏Ã±ÕéorÕóÃ¨kers... you can already picture everyone *diseappearing* or dying from *heart attacks*.

### Custom effect items
- **Scroll of Town Portal**, a rare consumable item, teleports its user to the ship.
- **Basics of architecture**, a book filled with forbidden knowledge, you can read it to learn how to use those screws you borrowed from your aunt.
- **El Gazpacho**, a tasty drink, will heal you when consumed but with a risk of having *"side-effects"*. How long will your body be able to stand up after a sip of this common spanish drink?

### Fake airhorn
- Can be used to make loud annoying sounds, just like a real airhorn would.
- Sometimes it will trigger a custom *bad* effect, are you sure that this is the real one?

### The talking orb
- Are you pondering the orb? Or is it the orb that is pondering you? Do not be surprised, for this orb will scream, speak and laugh at you.
- I'm keeping this one's appearance a secret since it's the rarest scrap in the mod.

### Weapons
- **Comically Large Spoon**, a classic, does a little more damage than the shovel.
- The legendary **Stick**, a non-lethal weapon, but you should not use it on your friends...

### Noisy items
- **The King**, **Puppy Shark** and **Moogle** can all be used to make some funny sounds !
- The little orange square is called **crouton**, it's an obscure internet refererence that can be heard anywhere on the map when droped.

- Scraps with no special effects, but they come with custom audio. Some can even glow in dark places.

### Notes
Each item has a low/medium spawn chance on all moons, you will not find them easily. This is to keep the game as vanilla as possible while adding some rare scraps to find if you are lucky !

*You can modify any spawn chance in the config file if you want to.*

It's recommanded to have the mod [StarlancerAIFix](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/AudioKnight/StarlancerAIFix/) installed but I will not spoil why... ü§´

### Feedback
You can post some suggestions or issues in the mod release page in the [modding discord](https://discord.com/invite/lcmod) or as a [github](https://github.com/ZigzagAwaka/PremiumScraps) issue.

### ToDo
- More scraps
